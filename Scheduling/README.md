<h1>File Descriptions: </h1>

<h3> Data: test files are in test folder and they are in text format. </h3>
    -the first line: n (number of tasks)
    -next n lines: <name of task> <entry time> <processing time> <deadline>

<h3>Genetic algorithm is in GA.ipynb, it includes genetic algorithm and a small scripts to store the number of violations and running time of GA on each test, these result is saved in r_GA.txt</h3>

<h3>Stochastic Hill Climbing is in SHC.ipynb, it includes stocchastic hill climbing algorithm and a small scripts to store the number of violations and running time of SHC on each test, these result is saved in r_SHC.txt</h3>

<h3>Visualize.ipynb is a sript to compare the effectiveness of these algorithms by graph using results in r_GA.txt and r_SHC.txt</h3>

<h3>Output: The results of GA and SHC are in results_GA.txt and results_SHC.txt, respectively</h3>
 
<h3>Scheduling Report: The docuement has the report for the scheduling problem solution</h3>
